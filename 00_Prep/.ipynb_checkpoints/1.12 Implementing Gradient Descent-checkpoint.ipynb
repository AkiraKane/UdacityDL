    "- we actually need to transform the data first. The rank feature is categorical, the numbers don't encode any sort of relative values. Rank 2 is not twice as much as rank 1, rank 3 is not 1.5 more than rank 2. Instead, we need to use dummy variables to encode rank, splitting the data into four new columns encoded with ones or zeros.\n",
    "- We'll also need to standardize the GRE and GPA data, which means to scale the values such they have zero mean and a standard deviation of 1. This is necessary because the sigmoid function squashes really small and really large inputs. The gradient of really small and large inputs is zero, which means that the gradient descent step will go to zero too. "
