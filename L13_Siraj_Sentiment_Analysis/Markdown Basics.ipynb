    "My day job as a real estate agent requires a myriad of skills, ranging from accounting to negotiation to business analysis.  Frequently (about every three months) I whip out my marketing skills to advertise my business.  This time I decided to send out postcards to an entire neighborhood in which I had sold homes recently.  Typically, agents will buy a mail route from the post office and hand over their postcards.  In the spirit of frugality and proving a point, I cracked my knuckles and went hunting for data.\n",
    ">Get the shapefiles.  Wake County Open Data (or your local open data hub) has a wealth of county-level data including subdivision boundaries and individual address points.  Download both shapefiles and  load them into your favorite GIS program.  This step can probably be done in R, but I find using QGIS fairly intuitive and much faster at plotting large shapefiles."
